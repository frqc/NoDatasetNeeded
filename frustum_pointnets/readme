Run with Nvidia-docker
---
1. Install Nvidia driver, docker and wsl2. Change the default docker runtime
2. Build the docker image. Within wsl2 under the project dir:
    docker build -t pytorch_base .
   It will build a container named "pytorch_base"
3. Add python interpreter in PyCharm and use it.


After that, clicking the green triangle next to the script will run the function within the docker
environment. The output will be redirected to PyCharm's window.


main.py
----
Use for cuda test


frustum_pointnet.py
---
Its main can be used for a neural network. Dry run with dummy input


data_provider.py
---
Its main can be used for read the pickle file exported from data_toolbox


train.py
---
Not test yet. See pytorch's documentation for more info
